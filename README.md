## About <a name = "about"></a>

The Dating Site project provides functionality for creating, updating and deleting users, managing matches, and authenticating users through the issuance of JWT tokens. The project also implements data validation, which ensures the security and integrity of data in the system. Data storage, including hashed passwords, was carried out in a PostgreSQL database. Unit tests have also been written for the project.
